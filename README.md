#Python scripts

Just some python scripts I like to refer to / play around in my spare time:

curl.py - a challenge done earlier to check a version of a JSON file using pycurl library

easycurl.py - Same challenge, just done with urllib2 library

currency.py - Live tracker for currency exchange rates, uses http://api.fixer.io/latest
